                which is "the future of toothbrushes".</p>
            <p dir="auto">'SmarTeeth' proudly state that the device comes built-in with an immutable secret from the
                factory and enhances its security further by acquiring a stronger secret when first initialized. They
                also state that all external communications are encrypted.</p>
            <p dir="auto">After initial research we were able to extract two strings (one from each device you have). We
                are not sure what it is, but we believe it contains some kind of unique ID for the device:</p>

                Your Goal:
                Your goal is to research the security procedures the device conducts against the backend, and think of
                potential ways to circumvent them, or gain higher privileges.
                Expect to reveal secrets or find ways to trick the backend into thinking you are something you are not.
