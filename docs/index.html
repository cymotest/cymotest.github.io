            <p dir="auto">The task at hand is to research the flagship product of a Dental Hygiene company "SmarTeeth",
                which is advertised as "the future of toothbrushes".</p>
            <p dir="auto">'SmarTeeth' proudly states that their product comes built-in with an immutable secret from the
                factory, and further enhances its security by acquiring a stronger secret when first initialized. They
                also state that all external communications are encrypted.</p>
            <p dir="auto">After initial research, we were able to extract two strings (one from each of the devices). We
                are not sure what they are, but we believe they contain some type of unique ID for the device</p>
            <p dir="auto">
                The two strings and their acquired secrets  are seen below:

                Your Goal:
                Research the security procedures the device conducts against the backend, and think of
                potential ways to circumvent them or gain higher privileges.
                In this task expect to reveal secrets or find ways to trick the backend into thinking you are something you are not.
